# ChessHorse
An ancient project that was written a year before I start my Developer career, when I was working in Novosibirsk Budker's Insitute of Nuclear Physics. It is a program with GUI for building knight's tour on chess board and animating it. The greedy algorithm by Warnsdorf's rule is used: the knight is moved so that it always proceeds to the square from which the knight will have the fewest onward moves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabWindows/CVI is used for GUI.
