# ChessHorse
An ancient project that was written a year before I start my Developer career, when I was working in Novosibirsk Budker's Insitute of Nuclear Physics. It is a program with GUI for building knight's tour on chess board and animating it. The greedy algorithm by Warnsdorf's rule is used: the knight is moved so that it always proceeds to the square from which the knight will have the fewest onward moves. To prevent the knight from entering dead end, the number of possible moves is counted on every step for two following steps. LabWindows/CVI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabWindows/CVI) is used for GUI.
